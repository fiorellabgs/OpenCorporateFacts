    <h1>Welcome to OpenCorporateFacts</h1>
    <h2>What is OCF ?</h2>
    <p>A 2019 project for making the corporate world - starting with France - more transparent, notably on the revenue split between work and capital, that consists of :
<ul>
  <li>a database built from open data sets and other publicly available sources by members of Code For France and other contributors;</li>
  <li>a tool allowing users to visualize data, compare between companies, and contribute to improve the data and the database.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>What you can find in OCF (at this stage)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>open information on companies, through existing administrative datasets (INSEE/INPI), that have been checked and refined to make them usable;</li>
  <li>data that were collected through other publicly available sources, such as shareholders’ reports and information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use Open Corporate Facts</h2>
  <p>Browse companies of your choice :
        {{ form_start(form) }}
        {{ form_widget(form) }}
        {{ form_end(form) }}
  </p>
  <p>But also add new data :</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="{{ url('add_corporate') }}">Add a new compagny</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{ url('add_shareholding') }}">Add new links between companies</a></li>
